# Gemini CLI Session Summary

## Last Session Date: 2025年10月30日木曜日

## Project Status Overview

### 1. Follow Feature & UI Improvements
- **Status:** Fixed and deployed.
- **Details:**
  - **Backend Logic (`src/utils/profile.ts`):** `followUser` and `unfollowUser` functions were refactored to use Firebase Firestore's atomic **batched writes**. This ensures data consistency across multiple document updates (follower list, following list, and user stats).
  - **Firestore Security Rules (`firestore.rules`):** The rule for updating user profiles (`/users/{userId}/profile/data`) was simplified and corrected to properly allow authenticated users to update the `stats` field (e.g., `followerCount`, `followingCount`). This resolved the "Missing or insufficient permissions" error.
  - **Frontend UI (`src/components/social/UserListModal.tsx`, `FollowersListModal.tsx`, `FollowingListModal.tsx`):**
    - A reusable `UserListModal` component was created to display user lists (followers/following).
    - This modal now displays user avatars, `displayName`, and `@username`.
    - Each user entry is clickable and navigates to their profile page.
    - "Follow" / "Following" / "Unfollow" buttons are dynamically displayed and functional within the list.
    - The modal's styling was adapted to conform to the project's existing `global.css` design system.
  - **Navigation:** The navigation flow from `SocialScreen` -> `UserProfileScreen` -> `FollowersListModal`/`FollowingListModal` -> `UserListModal` was correctly implemented to allow seamless profile navigation.

### 2. Cloud Functions Deployment
- **Status:** All Cloud Functions are successfully deployed as 2nd Generation functions.
- **Details:**
  - **Node.js Runtime:** Upgraded from Node.js 18 to Node.js 20 in `functions/package.json`.
  - **`firebase-functions` API:** All functions (`sendVerificationEmail`, `sendPasswordResetEmail`, `resetPassword`, `deleteAllFollows`, `deleteAllPosts`) were migrated to use the `firebase-functions` v2 API syntax (e.g., `functions.https.onCall({ ... }, async (request) => { ... })`).
  - **Dependencies:** `npm install` was run in the `functions` directory to generate `package-lock.json` and update `firebase-functions` to the latest version, resolving build issues.
  - **Deployment Process:** Required deleting existing 1st Gen functions from Firebase before deploying the new 2nd Gen versions.

### 3. Temporary Admin Panel
- **Status:** Deployed and ready for use.
- **Details:**
  - A temporary `AdminScreen.tsx` component was created.
  - This screen is accessible via an "Admin" button in the header.
  - It is only visible and usable if the logged-in user's username is `@haachan`.
  - It contains buttons to call `deleteAllPosts` and `deleteAllFollows` Cloud Functions.

## Current Task

- **Data Deletion:** The user needs to log in as `@haachan`, navigate to the Admin panel, and click the "Delete All Posts" and "Delete All Follows" buttons to clear the application's social data as requested.

## Next Steps (after data deletion is confirmed)

1.  **Clean Up Admin Panel:** Remove the temporary `AdminScreen.tsx` component, its associated navigation in `Layout.tsx` and `Header.tsx`, and the `deleteAllFollows`/`deleteAllPosts` Cloud Functions from `functions/src/index.ts`.
2.  **Implement New Features (in order of priority/complexity):
    a.  Direct Messaging (DM) Feature
    b.  Video Posts Feature
    c.  Stories Feature
    d.  Trending Words Feature** (showing popular words, excluding conjunctions, not just hashtags).

## Key Learnings/Challenges during this session

-   **Misleading Error Messages:** The `FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions` was a red herring, initially caused by an un-updated `firestore.rules` file, and later by a client-side network block (`ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT`) which Firebase SDK misinterpreted.
-   **`firebase-functions` v1 vs. v2 Migration:** Direct upgrade from 1st Gen to 2nd Gen functions is not supported; existing functions must be deleted before deploying new generation versions. API syntax for `https.onCall` and `runWith` changed significantly.
-   **Node.js Runtime Decommissioning:** Firebase decommissioned Node.js 18, requiring an upgrade to Node.js 20 for Cloud Functions.
-   **`npm ci` and `package-lock.json`:** Firebase's build process for functions uses `npm ci`, necessitating a `package-lock.json` file in the `functions` directory.
-   **`run_shell_command` Pathing:** The `directory` parameter for `run_shell_command` expects a relative path from the agent's root working directory, not necessarily the project root.
-   **Importance of Verification:** Crucial to verify file changes on disk (e.g., `firestore.rules`) immediately after a `replace`/`write_file` operation, especially when the tool reports success but the change might not have been applied as intended.
-   **Atomic Operations:** The `followUser`/`unfollowUser` functions were made robust using Firestore's batched writes to ensure data consistency.
-   **UI/UX Consistency:** New UI components must strictly adhere to existing project styling conventions (CSS variables, class names, component structure) to maintain a cohesive user experience.
